"""Makes a preset play the note you press, without changing how it sounds: C4 plays C4, and a bass is transposed down by the player.

MOVE is how many semitones each preset's oscillators go up or down. The filter follows the key, not the oscillators, so the
sound only stays the same if CUTOFF moves against KEYTRACK by the same amount; a preset then renders the same as before, played
that many semitones away from its old key. A bass has its lowest oscillator you can hear on the note (a sub more than 15 dB down is colour, not the note); anything else has
the pitch heard most on the note.

Basses are moved here rather than rewritten in their packs so that this stays one reviewable step. New presets just start on the note."""
